My game submission to js13k Games 2017!

This is a pure html/css/js text based game. Based off the text based oregon trail game found [here](https://gamedevacademy.org/js13kgames-tutorial/)! This is truly my first web based game and hope to continue building this and make it more of _my_ game.

Thanks Zenva for making this great tutorial!

Thanks for the opportunity,
